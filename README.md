## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### `xfreerdp: command not found`
```bash
sudo pacman -S freerdp
```

### `setxkbmap: command not found`
```bash
sudo pacman -S xorg-setxkbmap
```

### `scrot: command not found`
```bash
sudo pacman -S scrot
```

### PyQt6 Import Error
```bash
sudo pacman -S python-pyqt6
# or
pip install PyQt6
```

### Connection Refused / NLA Error
- Ensure your Windows server has RDP enabled (System Properties → Remote Desktop)
- Try disabling **NLA** in the Advanced tab if your server doesn't support it
- Try enabling **"Don't validate certificate"** for self-signed cert environments

### Black Screen After Connect
- Try switching **Graphics Mode** from Auto to **H.264** or **RFX**
- Lower the **Quality** setting
- Try a lower resolution
